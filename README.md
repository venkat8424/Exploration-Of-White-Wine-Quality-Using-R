# Exploration of white wine quaity using R

This project uses R to explore the various chemical factors that affect the quality of white wine. The dataset contains
information about 4898 wines and the quality rating received by each wine. The goal of this project was to identify the 
variables that had a strong relationship with the quality of the wine. The exploratory analysis was done using the 'ggplot'
library of R.

The analysis did not reveal any strong relationships among the chemical factors and the variables were not strongly 
correlated to each other. This was because the dataset had only the information about chemical factors and the quality 
of the wine depends more on other factors such as the quality of the grapes, the region from where the grapes were 
picked, the climatic conditions etc. The analysis can be improved if such information was available and also a predictive
model could be built.

Running the project

The analysis is done in an R markdown notebook and the results can be seen by running the individual cells of the notebook.
A knitted html file of the markdown notebook is also available to directly see the results.
